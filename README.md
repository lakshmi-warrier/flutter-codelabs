# Flutter Codelabs
This repo contains the apps I made as a part of learning Flutter from its [codelabs](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs)

1. [Startup Namer](startup_namer): This app generates infinite number of names (a pair of words) as we scroll down the list
2. [Startup Namer 2](startup_namer_2): an option of adding and filtering favourites was added
3. [Sign-in page](signin_example): A web app in Flutter that has a simple sign in page
4. [Friendly Chat App](friendly_chat): an app to learn implementation of beautiful UI
